                <div class="text">
                    <p>Midtown High student Jessica Campbell was present when Peter Parker was bitten by the
                        irradiated spider which gave him his radioactive powers. She had a crush on him,
                        and had just plucked up the courage to speak to him when he was distracted by the bite.
                        She also had a celebrity crush on teen heart-throb Johnny Storm.
                        Jessica's father received tickets for Disney World from his boss Tony Stark.
                        On the way home, their car collided with a military convoy carrying radioactive chemicals.
                        Her family was killed, and, after spending several months in a coma, she awoke, stirred by the
                        first coming of Galactus outside her hospital room. </p>
